<b>Aceproxy installer for Ubuntu</b>

 This script will work on Ubuntu and probably other distros
 of the same families, although no support is offered for them. It isn't
 bulletproof but it will probably work if you simply want to setup a AceProxy on
 your Ubuntu box. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and
 universal as possible.
